Although several post-normalization strategies have been studied, these methods pay more close attention to effect of normalization on covariance representations rather than the whole GCP networks, and their effectiveness requires further understanding.  Meanwhile, existing effective post-normalization strategies (e.g., matrix power normalization) usually suffer from high computational complexity (e.g., O(d3) for d-dimensional inputs).  To handle above issues, this work first analyzes the effect of post-normalization from the perspective of training GCP networks.
