Although several post-normalization strategies have been studied, these methods pay more close attention to effect of normalization on covariance representations rather than the whole GCP networks, and their effectiveness requires further understanding.  Meanwhile, existing effective post-normalization strategies (e.g., matrix power normalization) usually suffer from high computational complexity (e.g., O(d3) for d-dimensional inputs).  To handle above issues, this work first analyzes the effect of post-normalization from the perspective of training GCP networks.  Particularly, we for the first time show that effective post-normalization can make a good trade-off between representation decorrelation and information preservation for GCP, which are crucial to alleviate over-fitting and increase representation ability of deep GCP networks, respectively.  Based on this finding, we can improve existing post- normalization methods with some small modifications, providing further support to our observation.  Furthermore, this finding encourages us to propose a novel pre-normalization method for GCP (namely DropCov), which develops an adaptive channel dropout on features right before GCP, aiming to reach trade-off between representation decorrelation and information preservation in a more efficient way.  Our DropCov only has a linear complexity of O(d), while being free for inference.  Extensive experiments on various benchmarks (i.e., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-C, ImageNet-A, Stylized-ImageNet, and iNat2017) show our DropCov is superior to the counterparts in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, and provides a simple yet effective method to improve performance of deep architectures involving both deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs)."}

In this paper, we study the sample complexity of the learn-to-stabilize problem in Linear Time- Invariant (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. Current state-of-the-art approaches require a sample complexity linear in n, the state dimension, which incurs a state norm that blows up exponentially in n. We propose a novel algorithm based on spectral decomposition that only needs to learn \u00d2a small part\u00d3 of the dynamical matrix acting on its unstable subspace. We show that, under proper assumptions, our algorithm stabilizes an LTI system on a single trajectory with O__(k) samples, where k is the instability index of the system. This represents the first sub-linear sample complex- ity result for the stabilization of LTI systems under the regime when k = o(n)."}

Existing methods usually treat each rank as a category and employ a set of weights to learn these concepts. These methods are easy to overfit and usually attain unsatisfactory performance as the learned concepts are mainly derived from the training set. Recent large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have shown impressive performance on various visual tasks. In this paper, we propose to learn the rank concepts from the rich semantic CLIP latent space. Specifically, we reformulate this task as an image-language matching problem with a contrastive objective, which regards labels as text and obtains a language prototype from a text encoder for each rank. While prompt engineering for CLIP is extremely time-consuming, we propose OrdinalCLIP, a differentiable prompting method for adapting CLIP for ordinal regression. OrdinalCLIP consists of learnable context tokens and learnable rank embeddings; The learnable rank embeddings are constructed by explicitly modeling numerical continuity, resulting in well-ordered, compact language prototypes in the CLIP space. Once learned, we can only save the language prototypes and discard the huge language model, resulting in zero additional computational overhead compared with the linear head counterpart. Experimental results show that our paradigm achieves competitive performance in general ordinal regression tasks, and gains improvements in few-shot and distribution shift settings for age estimation."}

The proof is based on a refinement of mean-square analysis in Li et al. (2019), and this refined framework automates the analysis of a large class of sampling algorithms based on discretizations of contractive SDEs. Using this framework, we establish an O(sqrt(d)\/sigma) mixing time bound for LMC, without warm start, under the common log-smooth and log-strongly-convex conditions, plus a growth condition on the 3rd-order derivative of the potential of target measures. This bound improves the best previously known O(d\/sigma)  result and is optimal (in terms of order) in both dimension d and accuracy tolerance _ for target measures satisfying the aforementioned assumptions. Our theoretical analysis is further validated by numerical experiments."}

The belief was challenged by recent studies where we can maintain the robustness and improve the accuracy. However, the other direc- tion, we can keep the accuracy and improve the robustness, is conceptually and practically more interesting, since robust accuracy should be lower than standard accuracy for any model. In this paper, we show this direction is also promising. Firstly, we find even over-parameterized deep networks may still have insufficient model capacity, because adversarial training has an overwhelming smoothing ef- fect. Secondly, given limited model capacity, we argue adversarial data should have unequal importance: geometrically speaking, a natural data point closer to\/farther from the class boundary is less\/more robust, and the corresponding ad- versarial data point should be assigned with larger\/smaller weight. Finally, to implement the idea, we propose geometry-aware instance-reweighted adversar- ial training, where the weights are based on how difficult it is to attack a natural data point. Experiments show that our proposal boosts the robustness of standard adversarial training; combining two directions, we improve both robustness and accuracy of standard adversarial training."}
